# MTJSE

These codes are for processing, plotting, and otherwise investigating the data from the 1993-1994 series of active source seismic experiments near the Mendocino Triple Junction of northern California/ southern Oregon collectively dubbed the Mendocino Triple Junction Seismic Experiment (MTJSE).

The portions of the experiment are as follows:

MENI: 1993 onshore active source survey along 3 lines

MENII: 1994 onshore/offshore active source survey utilizing bother wide-angle shots to reoccupied 1993 sites as well as MCS imaging of the offshore region

MENA: Contemporary with the 1994 MENII survey, a 3D network was setup within the seismic lines

MENDO: Contemporary with the 1994 MENII survey, extension of onshore lines for wide angle imaging as well as numerous new lines parallel and perpenicular to slab dip

MCKSH: Piggy back refraction experiment during a 1993 4 shot calibration of the future network and identify recording conditions
